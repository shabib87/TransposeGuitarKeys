# TransposeGuitarKeys

This is a simple app to transpose guitar keys for rythym pattern to common suitable chords of that key. For example, in a typical G major key song the possible chord combinations are G, Em, C, D, Am, Bm and B. These chords can be in any combination and there might be other chords, but most of the songs would contain a variaiton of only these chords (more typically you will only see G, Em, C, D for a G major key song). 

This app helps to transpose these frequently used chords if you are transpoing the key of the song. i.e. if you want to transpose the G major song to F major and you don't want to calculate the possible combinations (F, Dm, A#, C, Gm, Am, A).
